Scalable Puppet Architecture


Key Components:

PuppetMaster
PuppetAgent
PubbetDB (Optional)
Foreman
PuppetConsole
MCollective


ScalingUp PuppetMaster

	Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests to different Puppet Master instances.

		Agent

		server = lb.puppetmaster.com

		LB

		  8140 puppet1.com
		  8140 puppet2.com

		

PuppetDB

	Configure PuppetDB with sharding to handle large datasets. 
	Distribute data storage and query load across multiple PuppetDB instances.


	

  A scalable Puppet architecture involves:

	1) Multiple Puppet Masters: Load-balanced for high availability and performance.
	2) PuppetDB: Configured for high performance and scalability.
	3) Hiera: Organized for efficient data lookup.
	4) Monitoring and Management: Ensuring system performance and reliability.
