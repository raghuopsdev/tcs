gem install r10k
r10k version



//Location of the main config file, may vary based on OS version
## /etc/puppet/r10k/r10k.yaml

# Sample R10k configuration file

# The source of Puppet code repositories
sources:
  my_source:
    remote: 'https://github.com/raghuopsdev/tcs.git'
    basedir: '/etc/puppet/code/environments'
    branch: 'main'  # or 'master' or any other branch
   # prefix: 'myorg'

//To deploy entire environment
r10k deploy environment -p

//Deploy on the module
r10k deploy module -p

//Testing R10K configuration
r10k puppetfile install


//Sample puppet file
forge 'https://forge.puppet.com'
mod 'puppetlabs/stdlib', '6.0.0'
mod 'puppetlabs/apache', '6.0.0'


//multiple branches and multiple environments
sources:
  my_source:
    remote: 'https://github.com/your_org/your_puppet_repo.git'

   //not recommended
   //   remote: 'https://username:password@github.com/your_org/your_repo.git'

   
   //git config --global credential.helper store
   
   //git clone https://github.com/your_org/your_repo.git


   //Puppet Master Create SSH key
   //ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   //Public key 
   // cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   //Add SSH key to githhub repository.

   //export GIT_USERNAME='your_username'
   //export GIT_PASSWORD='your_password'

    basedir: '/etc/puppet/code/environments'
    branch: 'main'
    environment:
      production:
        branch: 'production'
      development:
        branch: 'development'


//Logs

Review logs for errors (/var/log/puppetlabs/).
Ensure the r10k.yaml file is correctly formatted and paths are accurate.


//Description

r10k.yaml: Configures how R10k fetches and deploys Puppet environments and modules. It defines repository sources and deployment paths.
Puppetfile: Lists and manages the Puppet modules and their versions, allowing R10k to resolve and install these modules when deploying environments.
