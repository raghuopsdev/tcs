Data caching

Overview of Data Caching in Puppet


Facts Caching:

	Custom Facts: Facts are collected by Puppet from each node and can be cached to avoid re-computation.
	Facter Cache: The Facter library, which Puppet uses to gather facts, can cache facts to speed up the process.

External Data Sources:

	Hiera: Puppetâ€™s hierarchical data lookup tool, Hiera, can cache data retrieved from external sources like YAML files, 	databases, or other backends.
	
Catalogs:
	Cached Catalogs: Puppet can cache compiled catalogs on the Puppet master and agent to avoid regenerating them for each agent run.
