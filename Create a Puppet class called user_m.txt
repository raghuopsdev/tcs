Create a Puppet class called user_management that manages user accounts on a system. The class should accept the following parameters:


username: The name of the user account to be created (must be a String).
uid: The user ID (UID) for the account (must be an Integer).
home_directory: The home directory for the user (must be an Optional[String]).
groups: A list of groups that the user should be a member of (must be an Array[String]).
shell: The default shell for the user (must be a String with a default value of '/bin/bash')



The class should validate the data types of these parameters and then create the user account using the user resource. If the home_directory is not provided, it should default to /home/username.

Example Input:
---------------------
username: 'john_doe'
uid: 1001
home_directory: '/custom/home/john_doe'
groups: ['wheel', 'devops']
shell: '/bin/zsh'
